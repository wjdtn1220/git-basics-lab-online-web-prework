# Git Basics Lab

## Learning Goals

- Understand how to complete labs on Learn
- Apply what you've learned about Git version control
- Initialize a new Git repository
- Stage and commit new content
- Create a remote repository on GitHub
- Connect the newly create local repository with the remote on GitHub

## Introduction

So far lessons have only contained written content on specific topics. All you
needed to do was read through each lesson and continue on. This lesson, however,
is considered a _lab_. Labs are exercises that have some written content to
guide you, but also contain _tests_ that must be passed in order to complete
the lesson.

Now that you've learned about Git version control, in this lab, we're going to
go through the entire process of creating a local Git repository, creating an
initial commit and pushing that work to a remote repo stored on
[GitHub][github].

**Note:** If you are new to using Learn.co and this is your first lab, welcome!
This lesson will include all the steps necessary to submit your lab work to Learn.co.

## Getting Started

To start work on this lab, while on Learn.co, click the "Open IDE" button.

> If you are using the in-browser Learn IDE, the IDE will open on the page

> If you are using the Learn IDE on your computer, the IDE should open
> automatically

> If you are using your own local environment set up, you will need to manually
> fork and clone this lesson. Click on the GitHub button next to "Open IDE" to
> visit this lab's repository. Once there, create a personal fork of the repo
> and clone it down

Once you've got the lesson open, run `learn` in the command line. Six failed
tests should print out, starting with this:

```text
this lab
  1) has a folder named my-repository
  2) has a valid git repository initialized for the my-repository folder
  3) has a README.md file in the my-repository folder

the local repository
  4) has README.md as a tracked file
  5) has at least one commit
  6) has been pushed up to the remote repository


0 passing (42ms)
6 failing

1) this lab
     has a folder named my-repository:
   AssertionError: no folder name "my-repository" was found: value: expected './my-repository' to exist
    at Function.<anonymous> (node_modules/chai-fs/lib/assertions/directory.js:21:53)
    at Function.ctx.(anonymous function) [as directory] (node_modules/chai/lib/chai/utils/addMethod.js:41:25)
    at Function.assert.isDirectory (node_modules/chai-fs/lib/assertions/directory.js:34:35)
    at Context.it (test/index-test.js:11:19)
    ...
```

Each failed test includes an explanation. In the first test seen above, for
instance, it says `this lab has a folder name my-repository`, followed by
`AssertionError: no folder name "my-repository" was found`. This test is looking
specifically for a folder, `my-repository`, to exist inside this lab. To pass
this test, create a folder by that name and run `learn` again. If successful,
you should only see _five_ failed tests. One down, five more to go.

## Instructions

To get all tests passing in this lab, follow the steps below, applying commands
you've learned in the previous lessons. You can track your progress in the lab
at any time by running `learn` to see what tests are passing and failing.

**Note:** You must be in the main repository folder of this lesson to run the
tests. If you navigate into a new folder, make sure to use `cd ..` until you're
back in the `git-basics-lab` folder before running `learn`.

### Steps
co
1. Create a new folder locally named `my-repository`. This folder should be side
   by side with the `test` folder of this lab.

2. Navigate into the new folder using `cd` on the command line.

3. While inside `my-repository`, using the command line, initialize a new git
   repository. You'll know you've done it if you see 'Initialized empty Git
   repository in <...your local directory>/my-repository/.git/'

4. Create a README.md file inside `my-repository`.

5. If you run `git status` in your command line, you should see that `README.md`
   is now listed as an untracked file. Add `README.md` so that it is tracked by
   Git.

6. Once the file is tracked, running `git status` again will show that
   `README.md` is staged and ready to be committed. Go ahead and create a commit
   in the command line (don't forget to add `-m` when committing to include a
   message!)

   **Note:** If you forget to include `-m` on when committing, you'll find you've
   opened _vi_, the built in terminal text editor. To escape out of this editor,
   press the 'esc' key once, then type `:x!` to close the editor and return to
   the normal terminal.

7. Create a remote repository on [GitHub][github] using your personal GitHub
   account. When creating a blank repository, you will be given instructions for
   pushing an existing repository from the command line. Copy the first line
   (`git remote add origin...`) and run in your command line to connect your
   local repository with the new remote one.

8. Push up your local work to the remote.

After you've completed all the steps, run `learn` to confirm all tests are
passing. If some of the tests fail, follow the messages provided by each failing
test to fix them. If all tests are passing, when you run `learn`, Learn.co will
be notified and register that you've passed the tests.

Once you've passed all tests, run `learn submit` to register
completion of this lab on Learn.co.

## Conclusion

As you become more comfortable with the terminal and Git, you'll find yourself
using the workflow of initializing, adding, committing and pushing your work on
a regular basis. These commands are at the core of Git version control. By
knowing them, you now have the ability to create your own repositories and
contribute to repositories that already exist.

_*Fun Fact:*_ All Learn.co lessons, including this lab, are _themselves_ public
repositories on [GitHub][github]. Although some of the steps are not obvious,
when opening this lesson in the Learn IDE, you are actually _forking_ the
repository and _cloning_ it down. When you've passed all tests and run `learn submit`, you're pushing your work up to your own remote (and submitting
something called a [pull request][pr] to the original lab repo). If you ever
want to look back on how you solved a previous lab, they're all available on
your personal GitHub account.
